I"‚<p>The styles applied to Docster are very minimal. There are two colors used throughout the site and some syntax highlighting stylesheet.</p>

<p>If you want to change the colors you will find them within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_sass</code> directory in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">modules/_color</code> file. If you want to go with something else than green, you might want to change the variable name (and then just do a folder-wide search with the editor to replace. Almost every editor should have this feature).</p>

<p>Other than that feel free to just browse through the code and change things up as you like.</p>

I"“<p>Setting Docster up is super simple. Just like with all jekyll-sites you just need a GitHub account to host it. Docster is independent of any plugins so the only requirement is a jekyll installation to check the result before pushing.</p>

<p>So download this theme, navigate into the folder, open a terminal and type</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">jekyll serve</code></pre></figure>

<p>You will then be able to see the page at <strong>localhost:4000</strong> and make your changes. When you are happy just push them to github in a gh-pages branch and youâ€™re site will be compiled by GitHub for you.</p>

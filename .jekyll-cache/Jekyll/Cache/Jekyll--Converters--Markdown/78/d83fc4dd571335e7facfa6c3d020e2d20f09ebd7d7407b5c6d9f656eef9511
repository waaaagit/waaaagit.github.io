I"w<p>There is very few configuration to be done before you are up and running, still the ones you need to add, are as follows:</p>

<p>In the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>-file:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="c1"># name of the docs</span>
<span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Docster Documentation</span>

<span class="c1"># docs author</span>
<span class="na">author</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">DigitalMind</span>

<span class="c1"># docs version</span>
<span class="na">version</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">V 1.0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>All of these infos will be displayed on the top left-hand corner.</p>

<p>Of course you can also go in and change the sass-output-format or change whatever else you want to adjust.</p>

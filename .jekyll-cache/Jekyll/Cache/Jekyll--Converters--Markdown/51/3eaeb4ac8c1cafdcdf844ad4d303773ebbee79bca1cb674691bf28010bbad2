I"»<p>Welcome to this demo (and documentation) of Docster. A Documentation Theme for jekyll.</p>

<p>Here weâ€™ll show you what the theme looks like and how you will use it. Docster makes setting up an organized Documentation a breeze.
It has a sidebar, that is a table of contents and consists of links, that will scroll you to the respective section.</p>
